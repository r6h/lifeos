# LifeOS Whitepaper V3

## 🧭 Introduction

**LifeOS** is a modular, AI-powered, privacy-focused Life Operating System designed to help individuals define, refine, and pursue their purpose through intelligent, data-driven guidance. It blends deep identity modeling with dynamic life planning in a seamless, user-first interface. The platform is structured around two tightly integrated core modules:

- **Soul Engine** – The user identity and modeling engine.
- **Life Intelligence** – The dynamic decision graph engine for exploration and execution.

These modules work together within a unified, navigable graph-based interface that evolves with the user, enabling clarity, alignment, and action.

## 🔧 Core Modules Breakdown

### 🧬 1. Soul Engine (Identity Modeling)

- **Purpose:** Establish a deep psychological, philosophical, and behavioral model of the user.

- **Key Features:**

  - Initial profile creation via guided Q&A or minimal prompt input.
  - Continuous inference and updates through user interactions.
  - Semantic representation of values, beliefs, skills, fears, interests, and goals.
  - Vector embedding of identity traits for intelligent cross-referencing.

- **UX Representation:**

  - A mostly stable graph composed of self-defining nodes such as "Core Values," "Motivations," "Philosophy," etc.
  - This forms the backbone for the Life Intelligence engine.

- **Technical Implementation:**

  - Embedding engine built in Python (e.g., `sentence-transformers`).
  - Modular input pipeline using local-first logic and encrypted persistence.
  - Supports dynamic refinement through journaling and behavioral logging.

### 🧠 2. Life Intelligence (Goal Mapping & Guidance)

- **Purpose:** Map personalized, actionable life paths aligned with the user's Soul Profile.

- **Key Features:**

  - Constructs a dynamic graph of possible futures: decisions, goals, transitions.
  - Uses context-aware node generation and real-time scoring.
  - Explores scenarios with constraints, trade-offs, and simulations.

- **UX Representation:**

  - A zoomable, interactive life graph where nodes represent decisions, milestones, and suggestions.
  - Allows branching and previewing of alternate paths.

- **Technical Implementation:**

  - Graph generation in Python using domain templates and LLMs.
  - Scoring based on alignment to Soul Engine, feasibility, cost, and impact.
  - Powered by `networkx` or `neo4j` with ML-based ranking of paths.
  - Action and feedback loop continuously improves node accuracy.
