## 🚀 Project Vision

**Life OS** is a modular, AI-assisted, privacy-preserving operating system for personal growth, purpose discovery, and strategic life navigation.

Its **core mission** is to help individuals:
- Discover their **deep values, direction, and inner architecture**
- Generate an **interactive graph roadmap** of their ideal life
- **Guide decisions** and learning paths based on alignment with long-term goals
- Do so with **minimal input** and maximal privacy

This project is built with the values of **autonomy, privacy, and purpose-driven creation**.

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. **Soul Engine**
- Constructs a high-fidelity psychological model of the user
- Captures values, drivers, internal archetypes, blockers, and ambitions
- Builds identity-context nodes that inform roadmap construction

### 2. **Life Intelligence System**
- Graph engine that visualizes a directed roadmap of possible futures
- Calculates optimal paths, decision forks, and skill trees based on user data
- Suggests next moves with context from values, blockers, and interests

### 3. **Graph-Based Roadmap (UI Priority)**
- Central user-facing component
- Interactive visual graph (nodes = goals, skills, values, blockers)
- Edge weights define developmental sequences, tradeoffs, dependencies
- Supports branching paths and strategy selection

---

## 🎯 Target User

- Deeply curious, high-agency individuals
- Interested in AI, crypto, cybersecurity, systems thinking, self-development
- Likely Gen Z or Millennial, skeptical of traditional social media
- Wants more than productivity apps — seeks **directional clarity and purpose**

## 🔐 Design Philosophy

| Principle        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Privacy-first** | No cloud sync unless encrypted by user, local-first storage |
| **Minimal input** | 5–7 key questions must yield high-relevance roadmap |
| **Agency over automation** | No AI agents pretending to be you — system **augments**, not replaces decisions |
| **Data ownership** | All data belongs to the user; optional export/import as plain JSON or Markdown |
| **Composable system** | Built to allow optional integrations (Notion, Obsidian, web activity, etc.) |

---

## 🧠 Psychological Input Model

### Mandatory Inputs (MVP):
1. **Whose life do you admire?** → Archetype modeling
2. **What are you always drawn to?** → Deep themes & skills
3. **Top 3 Values** (choose from list) → Graph weight biases
4. **What’s holding you back?** → Blocker/energy drain modeling
5. **Ideal 5-year life (short paragraph)** → Terminal node anchors
6. **Current Interests & Domains** → Define graph scope (ML, crypto, design, etc.)
7. *(Optional)* What frustrates you about the world? → Moral alignment vector

## 🌐 Graph System Architecture

### Node Types:
- `Value`: e.g. [Autonomy], [Truth], [Freedom]
- `Interest`: e.g. [AI/ML], [Cybersecurity], [Ethereum]
- `Goal`: e.g. [Build privacy-first AI startup], [Learn ZK cryptography]
- `Skill`: e.g. [Deep learning], [Product design], [Rust]
- `Archetype`: e.g. [Builder], [Visionary founder], [Architect]
- `Blocker`: e.g. [Perfectionism], [Indecision], [Imposter syndrome]

### Edge Types:
- `Leads to`: Sequential dependency
- `Requires`: Skill dependency
- `Conflicts with`: Value dissonance or blocker interference
- `Amplifies`: Synergy multiplier (e.g. Skill → Archetype)
- `Unlocks`: Gate node (e.g. inner breakthrough → behavior change)

## 🛠 Technical Stack (Tentative)

| Layer         | Tools / Tech |
|---------------|--------------|
| Frontend      | React (Next.js), Tailwind, D3.js / Sigma.js for graphs |
| Backend       | Node.js (or Rust for graph engine), SQLite/local-first DB |
| AI/ML Layer   | Local inference (e.g., GGUF LLMs), transformer embedding models |
| Graph Engine  | Custom graph modeling in-memory or on disk, maybe using `graphlib` or Neo4j |
| Optional Sync | Local-first sync like Automerge or CRDTs, optional remote with encryption |

## 📅 Development Roadmap

### 🔹 Phase 0 — Foundation (Weeks 1–2)
- [x] Define project vision and architecture
- [x] Identify core components (Soul Engine, Life Intelligence, Graph)
- [x] Define minimal input strategy for MVP
- [x] Set design principles (privacy, minimalism, non-cliche AI)

### 🔹 Phase 1 — MVP Seed Engine (Weeks 3–5)
- [ ] Build the psychological input form (6 core questions)
- [ ] Encode answer-to-node translation logic (e.g., archetype inference)
- [ ] Generate static test graphs from seed inputs

### 🔹 Phase 2 — Graph Navigation System (Weeks 6–9)
- [ ] Build interactive graph UI (basic node interaction + info panes)
- [ ] Model edge types with meaning (e.g. blockers, synergy)
- [ ] Add path recommendation logic (manual rules first)

### 🔹 Phase 3 — Guidance Engine (Weeks 10–13)
- [ ] Add "pathfinder" feature: given node A and goal B, show best route
- [ ] Rank paths by value alignment, friction, and time horizon
- [ ] Add weekly reflection prompts to adjust weights

### 🔹 Phase 4 — Advanced Input Layer (Weeks 14+)
- [ ] Optional integration with Obsidian/Notion/bookmarks/etc.
- [ ] Temporal modeling of habits and decisions over time
- [ ] NLP pipeline for deeper vision parsing (embedding-based)

## 🧭 Future Features

- Weekly/Monthly “Life Strategy Review”
- Self-hosted version with encryption
- "Second brain" sync (Obsidian, Roam)
- Archetype-based mentorship/role model graph
- Life simulations: “What if you optimized for X?”

## 💬 Core Insight

Most people don’t need more content or productivity hacks.  
They need **clarity of direction** and a **sense of alignment**.

**Life OS** doesn’t replace your brain.  
It **externalizes your compass**—so you can *move* instead of *wander*.
