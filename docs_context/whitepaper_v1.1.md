# LifeOS: Whitepaper & Development Roadmap (v2)

## 🔥 Vision

**LifeOS** is a modular, privacy-respecting operating system for your inner world — built to help users align with their deepest values, define their identity, and navigate toward meaningful action. It combines AI, data ownership, and systemic introspection to generate a **navigable Life Intelligence graph** rooted in a deep user model called the **Soul Engine**.

It is not productivity software.  
It is not a to-do app.  
It is an **identity-aligned life intelligence system**.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- **Autonomy**: Help users know themselves and act in alignment.
- **Data Ownership**: User data is locally stored/encrypted, with optional consent to contribute anonymously to improve models.
- **Minimal Input → Maximal Clarity**: Extract actionable insights with the least required effort.
- **Purpose Before Optimization**: Before optimizing workflows, users must define what they value.

---

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 1. Soul Engine (User Identity Graph)
- A modular psychological and philosophical model of the user.
- Based on a hybrid of:
  - Stated preferences, goals, fears
  - Inferred patterns via inputs (text, behaviors, etc.)
- Represented as a **graph of identity traits** and life dimensions.
- Evolves over time.

### 2. Life Intelligence (Decision Graph Engine)
- Builds an evolving **graph of possible life paths**, challenges, and high-leverage actions.
- Rooted in the Soul Engine profile.
- Each node is a potential action, opportunity, pivot point, or insight.
- Navigation reveals dependencies, tradeoffs, and optimal choices.

### 3. Data Layer
- Optional ingestion of bookmarks, notes, habits, journaling, etc.
- Acts as contextual signal for both engines.
- 100% local or encrypted w/ opt-in contribution to model development.

### 4. Interface Layer (Terminal Prototype → GUI)
- Initially terminal-based.
- Final version is an interactive, explorable graph UI.
- Users land directly in Life Intelligence with the option to explore Soul Engine.

## 📐 Core UX Principle

> **Users don’t want to “explore their soul.” They want to know: What should I do next, and why?**

Therefore:
- Default screen: Life Intelligence graph
- Soul Engine is the model behind the map
- Users can inspect or tweak the model only when needed

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Backend**: Python (Core logic, soul/life graph engine, CLI prototype)
- **Frontend** (later): JS + React or similar (Graph UI)
- **Data**: Optional input integration (plain text, local notes)
- **Graph DB**: NetworkX (prototype), Neo4j or TigerGraph (later)
- **ML/NLP**: Language modeling, embedding-based matching, local transformer inference
- **Privacy**: Local-first architecture, zero-knowledge/zkML explorations in R&D phase

## 🧱 Development Phases

### 🧪 Phase 1: CLI Prototype (Terminal-Based)
- Build base classes:
  - `SoulProfile`
  - `Node`
  - `LifeGraph`
- Core data extraction from minimal prompts
- Simple soul-node generation + life-node mapping
- Graph traversal logic
- Output suggestions based on Soul–Life alignment

### 🧬 Phase 2: Internal Engine Maturity
- Expand internal Soul Engine schema
- Develop user profile evolution system
- Contextual feedback loop: "Did this help you?" rating to adjust graph logic
- First implementation of pathfinding/scoring heuristics

### 🖼️ Phase 3: Graphical Interface
- Implement LifeGraph in web UI (React or similar)
- Allow node inspection, filtering, and tagging
- Add zooming, collapsing, visual clusters

### 🔐 Phase 4: Data Privacy + Opt-In Model Learning
- Fully local storage
- Allow opt-in contribution of anonymized graph deltas
- Explore privacy-preserving model fine-tuning (ZK, FL, zkML)

### 🌐 Phase 5: Integration Layer (Optional Inputs)
- Pull data from:
  - Notes (markdown, Obsidian)
  - Bookmarks
  - Journals
  - GitHub activity
- Enrich user model without extra input burden

### 🚀 Phase 6: Intelligence Expansion
- Add collaborative graph features (only if privacy-respecting)
- Implement archetype-based navigation (e.g. Builder, Artist, Analyst)
- Incorporate external signal analysis (economic, social, trend-based suggestions)

## 🧭 Target Users

- Self-driven individuals interested in clarity, purpose, and leverage
- Technologically fluent, privacy-aware, introspective
- Not productivity addicts — but **purpose maximizers**

---

## 🧨 What It's Not

- ✘ Not an AI agent shell
- ✘ Not a chatbot
- ✘ Not an analytics dashboard
- ✘ Not a mirror of existing social paradigms

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- High-quality Life Graph suggestions with <5 input prompts
- Clear sense of direction after 1 session
- Accurate alignment between identity model and decisions
- Low dropout from first interaction
